Issue: Refusing to merge unrelated histories


# Navigate to your local repository directory
cd path/to/your/local/repo

intialize with branch main local
git init --initial-branch=main

# Fetch changes from the remote repository
git fetch origin

# Merge the remote branch into your current branch, allowing unrelated histories
git merge origin/main --allow-unrelated-histories

# Resolve any conflicts manually, if any
# git add . (if conflicts are resolved manually)

# Commit the merge
# git commit -m "Merge remote main with local main allowing unrelated histories"

# Push the merged changes to the remote repository
git push origin main
